  title={Periodic families in the homology of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$},
  author={Wang, Kelly},
  year={2026},
abstract={    We construct infinite families of nonzero classes in  $H_d(\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{F}_2);\mathbb{F}_2)$  along lines of the form $d =\frac{2}{3}n + $(constant), thereby showing that the known slope $\frac{2}{3}$-stability for these homology groups are optimal. Using the new stability Hopf algebra  perspective of Randal-Williams,  our computations in addition recover the slope-$\frac{2}{3}$ stability for $\GL_n(\Z)$ with coefficients in $\F_2$, improve that for $\Aut(F_n)$ to $\frac{2}{3}$, and demonstrate that those slopes are optimal.
    Perhaps of independent interest, we also provide a manual for computing stability Hopf algebras over $\mathbb{F}_2$.},
