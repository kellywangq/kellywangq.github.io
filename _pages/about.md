I am a second year phd student of [Oscar Randal-Williams](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~or257/) at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/).

I am interested in looking at homological stability via a homotopical lens, and anything broadly related.

Before this I was doing undergraduate and Part III at Cambridge.
